project: test-web

setup instructions

1. On your Tomcat directory, create a folder called "properties".
2. Inside the created directory ("properties") create "test-web" folder.
3. Put there app.properties file.
4. Open the file ${TOMCAT_HOME}\conf\catalina.properties and modify the properties "shared.loader" as it is indicated below:

shared.loader=${catalina.home}/properties

The line above will add to the shared classloader the "properties" directory. In this way, our application will locate our properties file (line 49 of spring-context.xml file) in ${TOMCAT_HOME}\properties\test-web\app.properties.

5. Note that the property value of "open_ui_location" in app.properties file is set as:

open_ui_location=https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.61.1

It means that it will load the openui5 resources from its CDN. 

If everything was done correctly, at this point the application should have loaded the resources of OpenUI5 from its CDN. Cheers!.
